# PoDBond

PoDBond is a powerful Node.js utility developed using ES modules. It provides seamless integration with the Printify API service. This tool is designed to simplify the process of working with the Printify API, enabling website administrators to efficiently manage their shops.

## Requirements

- Node.js (version 14.21.3 or higher)
- npm (version 6.14.18 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run the following command to install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and populate it with the required environment variables. Example:
   ```
   API_KEY=your-printify-api-key
   ```
   Replace `your-printify-api-key` with your actual Printify API key.

## Project Structure

The project follows a small camel case naming convention and has the following structure:

```

├── README.md
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── node_modules
├── index.mjs
└── utils
    ├── admin
    │   └── getShops.mjs

```

- `README.md`: This file contains information about the project and its usage.
- `package-lock.json`: This file is automatically generated and ensures consistent installations of project dependencies.
- `package.json`: This file lists the project details, dependencies, and scripts.
- `node_modules`: This directory contains all the project dependencies.
- `index.mjs`: The main entry point of the application.

The `utils` folder contains various utility functions used throughout the project. The `admin` folder within the `utils` folder specifically stores utility functions designed for website administrators.

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have set the Printify API key in the `.env` file as mentioned in the Installation section.
2. Update the `index.mjs` file with any necessary configuration changes.
3. Run the following command to start the utility:
   ```
   node index.mjs
   ```

### Usage

To use the functions, follow these steps:

1. Import the function in your code, getShops as demo:
   ```javascript
   import { getShops } from './utils/admin/getShops.mjs';
   ```

2. Call the function with the API key as an argument:
   ```javascript
   const result = await getShops(apiKey);
   ```

3. The function returns a Promise that resolves to the data containing shop details fetched from the Printify API.

### Example

Here's an example of how to use the `getShops` function:

```javascript
import { getShops } from './utils/admin/getShops.mjs';

const run = async () => {
  const result = await getShops(apiKey);
  console.log(result);
};

run().catch((err) => {
  console.error('An error occurred:', err);
});
```
